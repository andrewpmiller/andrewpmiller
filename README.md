# Hi there. I'm Andrew. ðŸ‘‹

**I design and make things. Some of them even work (as expected).**

Most of the time I'm the Program Director at [Aquent Gymnasium](http://thegymnasium.com) where I make sure we're delivering the very best online learning for designers and developers â€” _**for free**_. Yes. Seriously. Check it out.

The rest of the time I'm designing or making things that blink, bleep, and bloop.

I post my photos and noisy videos on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/laspalmas7), and you can see more of that on my [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@laspalmas7) channel. I also livestream my modular synth jams on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/andrewpmiller).
